# Pancreatic-cancer-subtypes-survival-linear-predictor
Show that there is no significant relationship between cancer subtypes and our linear predictor of survival



## DATA
- 4 subtypes : 1squamous 2immunogenic 3progenitor 4ADEX
- Retrieve by querying the TCGA GDC database (type = paad)
- Merge with the linear predictor of the models of interest (8)

### Objective: to verify that the cancer subtypes are independent of the linear predictor in continuous form (Anova) and dichotomized on Maxstat (Fisher)  

## RESULTS
The ANOVA test makes the following assumptions about the data:

- Independence of observations. Each subject must belong to only one group. There is no relationship between the observations in each group. No repeated measures are allowed for the same participants.

- No significant outliers in any cell of the design

- Normality. The data in each cell of the design should be approximately normally distributed.

- Homogeneity of variances. The variance of the response variable should be equal in each cell of the design.
